    VS CODE USE SOMETHING CALLED EMMET WHICH HELP US TO GENERATE CODE SNIPPET GIVEN THEN EXAMPLE YOU  SEE ENTER
    html:5 AND IT WILL GENERATE SOME CODE FOR YOU. BASIC SKALETON FOR HTML

<!-- 
    NEW THINGS OR WORD THAT I HEARD AND NEED TO GO DEEP INTO THAT.

    1. WHAT IS CDN.
    2. WHAT IS CROSSORIGIN : WE HAVE THAT IN CDN LINK
    3. WHY DO WE HAVE TWO CDN FILE LIKE REACT AND REACT-DOM ? (THIS IS BEST I KNOW ANSWER BUT GO DEEP)
    4. ATTRIBUTES VS PROPS

<!--
    NOW FIRST WE TRIED WITH HTML AND THEN WE TRIED WITH VANILA JS

    WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND ONE THING IS THAT TILL NOW WE DID NOT ADDED AND LIBRARY OR ANYTHING STILL OUR CODE RUNS
    BECAUSE BROWSER ARE CAPABLE TO UNDERSTAND ALL THIS DOCUMENT.CREATELEMENT OR ANY OTHER HTML TAG BUT NOW WHEN 
    WE WILL TRY TO CREATE SAME ABOVE PROGRAM WITH REACT WILL BROWSER UNDERSTAND THIS AND ANSWER IS NO.

    AND THATS THE REASON FIRST WE NEED TO INJECT REACT INTO OUR PROJECT NOW THERE ARE FEW WAYS WE CAN DO IT LIKE.

    1. WITH CDN LINK 
    2. THROUGH LIBRARY : (MOST OF TIME WE WILL DO IT WITH THIS ONLY BUT ITS GOOD TO UNDERSTAND WHY AND WHY NOT TO USE
    CDN LINK)
    3. DOES THE ORDER OF SCRIPT MATTERS LIKE SUPPOSE WE HAVE SCRIPT OF ./APP.JS FIRST AND THEN WE HAVE REACT AND REACT DOM SCRIPT
       WILL IT WORK SIMPLE ANSWER NO BECAUSE IN ./APP.JS WE ARE USING REACT AND IN INDEX.HTML REACT YET NOT EVEN LOADING INTO 
       OUR PROJECT
